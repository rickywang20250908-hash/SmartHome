# Smart Life Tech - Business Plan & Service Strategy (Canada Market)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strategic Pivot (2026)**: Shift from "Selling Tech/Hardware" to "Selling Peace of Mind/Risk Transfer".
> **Core Value**: We don't just "install smart homes"; we ensure your home is safe from leaks, network failures, and security breaches.

## 1. Target Audience Strategy ("Who Pays?")

Avoid "Shotgun Marketing". Focus strictly on **Category A** clients for Phase 1.

### 🎯 Primary Target: The "Tech-Anxious" High-Income Family
*   **Profile**: New homeowners or recently renovated. High disposable income (>150k HHI).
*   **Pain Points**:
    *   Has some devices (Tuya/Zigbee/HomeKit) but they are "messy" or unusable.
    *   Terrified of water leaks (expensive repairs) or internet outages (WFH disruption).
    *   Wants "It just works", not to learn how to code.
*   **Why them?**: They pay for **stability** and **service**, not gadgets.

### 🎯 Secondary Target: Small Business/Retail
*   **Profile**: Cafes, Boutique shops, Offices.
*   **Needs**: Remote monitoring, reliable Wi-Fi, "Open/Closed" status checks.

### 🚫 Anti-Target: The DIY/Geek
*   **Profile**: Technologically capable, loves Home Assistant.
*   **Why Avoid**: They will not pay for service. They only want to discuss technical implementation.

## 2. Product Lineup (The "Result" Economy)

### 🧱 Product 1: Core Automation Design (Consulting Only)
*   **Goal**: Create a reliable "system brain" without the liability of physical wiring.
*   **Format**: Virtual or On-site Consulting + Documentation.
*   **Deliverable**: System Architecture Map, YAML/Node-RED logic, and Hardware Spec.
*   **Price**: **$299 - $599 CAD** (Planning Fee).

### 🧱 Product 2: The "Guardian" Implementation (Referral Model)
*   **Concept**: We design, the Pro installs.
*   **Workflow**: 
    1. We design the solution.
    2. We provide the hardware (or buy-list).
    3. We coordinate with a licensed ESA Electrician for installation.
    4. We perform the final software programming.
*   **Price**: **Hardware Kit + $199 Configuration Fee**.

## 4. Compliance & Licensing Strategy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Regulatory Boundary**: Smart Life Tech operates as a **Technology Consulting & Software Service**. 
> We do NOT provide:
> - Regulated Electrical work (ESA)
> - Regulated Security Monitoring (ULC)
> - Regulated HVAC/Gas work (TSSA)

**Commercial Positioning**: "We are the Architects. We design the smart home's DNA. We partner with licensed trades for the physical infrastructure."

*   **Shift Copywriting**:
    *   FROM: "We use Home Assistant and Zigbee2MQTT" (Tech Speak)
    *   TO: "Never worry about a flooded basement again." (Result Speak)
*   **Three Key Scenarios to Highlight**:
    1.  **"The Midnight Leak"**: Auto-detection and alert before the floor is ruined.
    2.  **"The Dead Network"**: Knowing your home is offline before you lose connection to cameras.
    3.  **"The Empty Home"**: Vacation mode that simulates presence and monitors 24/7.
