## 💬 FAQ: "Do you have a license?" (The Standard Answer)

**The Response Script:**

> "In Ontario, licensing is specialized by trade. My expertise is in **Smart Home Systems Architecture & Automation Logic**—which focuses on the software, network reliability, and cross-platform communication. 
> 
> For the 'heavy lifting'—like new wiring or electrical panels—I work alongside licensed **ESA (Electrical Safety Authority)** electricians. This dual-layer approach ensures you get both a rock-solid automation system *and* a 100% code-compliant electrical installation. I design the 'brain,' and they install the 'nervous system.'"

## 📝 Service Agreement Clause (The "Protective" Text)

**Add this to every contract/proposal:**

**Section: Scope of Regulated Works**
*The Consultant provides system design, configuration, and technology consulting services. The client acknowledges that any work involving high-voltage electrical circuits (over 30V), security monitoring panels requiring ULC certification, or HVAC gas connections must be performed by a separately contracted, licensed trade professional. The Consultant is not a licensed electrician, security alarm installer, or HVAC technician.*
